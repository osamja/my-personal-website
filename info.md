# Deployment
 - To deploy, rather than running the deploy script, we should just run 
    `npm run build`
 - Find out which processes are listening on which ports
    * sudo netstat -tulpn

 - In order to keep, osamjaved.com and sammyjaved.com workign properly, 
 - I have setup old-server.js which runs on port 80.
 - It does a redirect to the https version of the site https://sammyjaved.com

### Product Backlog
 - Populate the Bio page
 - Populate the travel page
 - Remove blue underline from header
 - Clickable header should just be the text region
 - 
 - osamjaved.com should redirect to sammyjaved.com
 - Allow full url paths to fetch the appropriate route content
 - Add Home icon in Header
 - Create an error 404 page
 - Introduce a file for constant variables. 
    Ideally static files can be more easily hosted on a dedicated server in
    the future. 
 - URL redirect should occur server side
 - Spike how SASS works with create-react-app build setup
