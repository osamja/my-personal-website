# Deployment

 - To deploy, rather than running the deploy script, we should just run 
    `npm run build`
 - 

 - Find out which processes are listening on which ports
    * sudo netstat -tulpn

 
### Things to do:
 - Remove the '#' that is appearing in the URLs
    * Use BrowserRouter rather than HashRouter
