                    I wanted to study AI this year, and I figured why not study from Japan?  
                    Especially since I was able to book a flight from San Jose to Tokyo for 
                    $250 dollars.  I left San Jose at the end of February and I'm planning to 
                    head back to the United States in mid-may.  aka the extent of my three month
                    tourist visa.
