                <p>
                    I've officially begun my backpacking tour of Europe, starting with London.
                    I wanted to visit the UK because as a Pakistani American, Britain has at
                    some point colonized both Pakistan (via India) and America.  Therefore,
                    it's had an outsized influence on my life which I wanted to explore.

                <p>Alright this journal will be continued! Gotta go to sleep</p>
