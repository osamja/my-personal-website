      <!-- Overview of assignment -->
      In this assignment, I worked with Bezier surfaces and control
      points to draw curves.  Averaged the normals of meshes
      to interpolate shading across smooth surfaces. Split and flipped the
      edges of a halfedge data structure. Upsampled our triangles with
      4-1 loop subdivision. Implemented the Blinn-Phong and
      environment reflection shading model, and designed my own mesh. 
      </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Fun with Bezier Patches</h2>
        <p>In part 1, I tessellated a Bezier surface into triangles on
        an 8x8 grid. Tessellating a surface is analagous to sampling a
        surface. Since we're sampling on an 8x8 grid, I uniformly
        sampled the uv coordinates of the mesh by sampling every 1/8th
        interval. With bezier surfaces, we are given control points
        that determine the shape of our curve. In this assignment, we
        were given 16 control points, and to evaluate what points our
        curve would use, I had two choices. The first choice was to
        use De Casteljau's algorithm which works geometrically by
        recursively splits bezier curves until we basically have a
        tangent line to all the points in our curve, from which we can
        that start drawing our curve. The second approach to
        evaluating the uv coordinates was to use Bernstein
        polynomials. I used this approach because it was a more
        algebraic approach that I could easily translate into
        code. 3rd degree Bernstein polynomials allow us to evaluate
        fractions of a curve and then combine all these curves at the
        end to make one smooth curve. Using our control points and
        evaluating the uv coordinates, we were able to get all the
        3D points needed for our curve.  Finally, since we are working
        with meshes, it was important that once we had all the points
        for our triangle, that we could draw our triangle in a
        direction that was consistent for both our triangles. This
        allowed for our normal vector to point outward of our teapot
        rather than inward, which greatly affets the lighting of our object!
      </p>
      <p>One (embarrasing) debugging error I had during this part of
        the assignment was that I implemented the choose function
        wrong for the Bernstein polynomials. Fortunately, this led
        to me double checking all my work, which helped me gain a
        better understanding of what was going on.  </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h2>
        <p>In part2, I took the area-weighted average of the vertex
        normals to to get smoother shading on our surfaces.  Similar
        to anti-aliasing, averaging the vertex normals sort of blurs
        our image to make it more smooth. We're using the weighted
        average of the vertex normals to create a smooth gradient
        across our surface. Essentially, by giving openGL more surface
        normals to work with, we can create more accurate lighting
	  that results in smooth shading. </p>
	<p>The most difficult aspect with this part of the assignment
        was familiarizing and working with the halfedge data
        structure. Since we didn't have to change any values of our
        original mesh, I used const iterators for the traversal. The
	way I got the vectors was by getting each neighboring vertex,
	subtracting it by our vertex position and then
	  crossing it with the next neighboring vertex.  </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Edge Flip</h2>
        <p>In part 3, I implemented edge flips.  This would flip any
        non-boundary edge, such that the edge would disconnect from
        its old 2 vertex endpoints, and connect with the two adjacent
        endpoints. Although this operation seemed trivial at first, I
        had no idea the amount of pointers that would need to be
        involved and reassigned for an edge flip. Luckily, the
        edge/split guide on how to properly assign pointers really
        helped me learn the association between halfedges, vertices,
        edges, and faces. Once I drew my before/after edge flip
        diagram, assigning the pointers became a lot easier.
        Somethings to watch out for are to properly assign the
        halfedge pointers so that the direction is consistent for all
        triangles. (We don't want our surface normal to point inward,
        but outward of the teapot). Also the vertex corresponding to
        an halfedge is at its base, not where the hook of the halfedge
        lies.</p>
        <p>When I was initially assigning my halfedge pointers, I
        didn't use the setNeighbors function, which turned 5 lines of
        code into 1 for each halfedge pointer. The first time I tried
        to flip an edge, I was getting holes in my teapot. I knew the
        cause of this was a misassigned pointer, which it was!
        However, I knew that if I wanted to gain a better grasp of my
        pointers, the setNeighbors function would be more necessary
        since it greatly reduced the complexity of maintaining my flip
        and soon split edge functions. A progamming lesson I took away
        from part 3 is that software in a way is really about just
        managing complexity. There can be a lot of moving parts in a
        large program and so if I can make my code more concise, it
        would make my code more readable and easier to debug.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Split</h2>
        <p>The edge split was more challenging than the flip since
        splitting in edge resulted in creating 6 halfedges, 1
        vertex, 3 edges, and 2 faces. By splitting an edge between two
        triangles, we now get 4 triangles. All 4 of them being split
        where the newest vertex was created. My before diagram of the
        edge split was identical to that of the edge flip. However, my
        after diagram was much different partially because of how the
        newly allocated halfedge objects were now halfeges for the two
        created triangles.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The biggest challenge I had with split edge was creating the
    new halfedge objects. I tried creating objects similar to how they
    were made in edge flip, but this resulted in a dead end since I
    would not have a halfedge defined before its twin, and the twin
    not assigned before the halfedge. This circular loop made me
    realize that there had to be some other way of creating new
    halfedge objects. The real anchor in split edge, really happens at
    the newly created vertex where we specify its position to be the
    midpoint of the the edge it just split. We use this vertex, as an
    anchor to start defining all our other halfedge objects around
    this vertex point. (I could finally say that halfedge h0 points to
    the newly created vertex4)

    <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Upsampling via Loop Subdivision</h2>
        <p>In part 5 I implemented upsampling via loop subdivision. What this basically does is split every triangle into 4 triangles smaller triangles. In this way, we are sort of subdividing our mesh to get finer and finer triangles across our surface. Although it may seem like we are just making smaller triangles, we are also recalculating the vertex positions and where they would be placed by approximating the values of our original triangle. We're using information about our original triangle to determine how the newer triangles should be placed on our surface. </p>

		<p>
			Part 5 was by far the most time consuming and challenging part of the project for me. It took me 3 weekend days! (But was totally worth it) Part 5 used the edge split in part 4 to subdivide all of our edges, and then we used the edge flip in part 4 to flip the edge to neatly get our 4-1 triangle. A lot of work was done in pre-processing the triangle where we set all the old vertices and edges as not being new. This was to know what edges would need to be split later since we don't want to split edges that were just created. The major bugs I had with this part was that I was flipping edges I thought were to be new rather than false. These 2 edges were among the edge that we just split. My other bug was that when I was determining whether or not to flip an edge, I was looking at its first and last vertices and seeing if they were new and old. I didn't think about the possibility that the first endpoint could have been old and the second endpoint new.

		<p>
		(Picture above)I'm not sure if I was able to perfectly subdivide my cube, but I did split all the edges prior to upsampling.  What I noticed was that my upsampled cube was a lot less rigged, especially around the edges. The sharp edges of the cube also began to go away and the result were edges that were extremeley rounded. I think this was happening because our re-weighing of the vertices didn't know how to approximate the corners of our cube accurately (where three edges are meeting).

    <h2 align="middle">Part 6: Fun with Shaders</h2>
        <p>For part 6, I implemented the Blinn-Phong reflection model and environment map reflection shading. For the Phong shading model, I computed the ambient, diffused, and specular values. The trick with getting the specular value right was that I needed to make the brighntess very intense, to do this I raised the dot product of my normal and halfvector near normal to the 65th power! As seen from the cosine power plots slide, increasing the p or power, made a more narrow and higher intensity light on my object. For the environment mapping, I was a little less sure of what I was doing.  Primarily because I was dealing with the theta/phi angles. These angles are used to get the spherical coordinates from which then we can then access the texture coordinates of our surface by dividng by 2pi and pi. </p>
		<p>
			Initially, I had some trouble working with the GLSL language. I tried importing some libraries, which I found out I wasn't allowed to do! I was also thrown off with some of the type declarations such as creating a vec3 type. The result of this shading was just awesome!
