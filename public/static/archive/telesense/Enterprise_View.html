      <h1>Enterprise View</h1>
    <code>The company names below have been modified for customer privacy.</code>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
	In the summer of 2016, I interned at an Internet of Things startup
 called <a href="http://telesense.com/">Telesense</a>.  The Internet of 
Things, or IoT for short, attempts to bring everyday objects online.  An IoT device
typically includes a bunch of sensors monitoring temperature, humidity, light, etc. 
By placing an IoT device in say a garden for example, the IoT device could sense when the 
garden needs more water or light, and send a reminder (via email/text) to the owner.    Our goal 
was to put our IoT devices in industrial environments (ex. food storage) where knowing 
real time info can be really helpful.  This included server rooms, grocery stores, food storage, and food distribution companies. 
	</p>
	<h3>Enterprise View</h3>
	<p>
	During my time at Telesense, I built an application, called the 'Enterprise View'.  The purpose of this application was to create a platform that could better tailor the needs of larger enterprise customers.  Large companies have multiple locations so we needed an interface that could display locations and their associative device status on one screen.
	</p>
	<p> Here's the color map used for each location/device</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Green: Device is currently within temperature and humidity thresholds.  </li>
		<li> Gray: Device is not connected to the internet, or not reporting. </li>
		<li> Red: Device is violating it's temperature or humidity threshold (too high or low). </li>
		<li>Location name of IoT device is shown above each device box </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Technology</h4>
	<p>I built the Enterprise View using PHP, MySQL, Javascript, and HTML5/CSS.  
The platform updated every minute dynamically via AJAX calls.
 The grid boxes were all dynamically resized thanks to the simple css responsive tricks by Graham Miller's <a href="http://responsivegridsystem.com">Responsive Grid</a>.
     The https certificate warnings displayed below are only because the pictures were taken off my development server.  </p>

		  <figcaption>If a company has too many locations, displaying all the associative devices on one screen can become problematic.  To address this, I created a location view hierarchy.  For a given enterprise, only the locations will be shown.  Each location is clickable, and doing so will take you to the device page, showing all devices associated with the clicked location.  </figcaption>
