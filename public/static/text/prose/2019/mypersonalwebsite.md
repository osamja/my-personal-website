# My Personal Website

### What
This website, `sammyjaved.com`, is my new personal website.
My intention for this site is for me to share interesting things, thoughts, and experiences from my life.
In the process, I hope to better my understanding of web development.  
Thanks for checking in on me!    

### Why 
I've been wanting to redo my personal website for a while now.
What's inspired my latest re-write of my site has been my desire to learn how to use React.
React is a framework for building user interfaces. 

In this age of content moderation, I think I've also been interested in having my own medium.
One that isn't censored or dependent on external services.
An ode to the old internet.  
I want to tell my story, and I think this site will help me express my story however I want.  

### How 

I boot strapped this application using the `create-react-app` framework.
This out-of-the-box framework was a great way for me to minimize the setup
involved with working on a new application.  React, Webpack, and a solid file
structure has already been provided.  This has allowed me to focus on the
application code and providing the content I wish.  

In summary, this is my tech stack for this website.
At the moment, this web application is a front-end app only.  

    User Interface - React Framework
        - Gallery component created to maximize re-usability
    Server side framework - Express JS 
    Build setup: Webpack
    Hosting provider: Linode (1 GB RAM) 
    Domain provider: Namecheap
