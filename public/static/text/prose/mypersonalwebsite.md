### What
This website, `sammyjaved.com`, is my new personal website.  My intention for this site is for me to share interesting things, thoughts, and experiences from my life.  In the process, I hope building my own website and maintaining it teaches me about how to manage a web service.  From setting up my web server, to publishing content.  Thanks for checking in on me.    

### Why 
I've been wanting to redo my personal website for a while now.  What's inspired my latest re-write of my site has been my desire to learn how to use React.  React is a framework for building user interfaces.  You see, given that this website is a personal side project, the only way I'll work on it is if it's fun and challenging for me.  Picking cool technologies helps me do that! 

In this age of content moderation, I think I've also been interested in having my own medium.  One that isn't censored or dependent on external services.  An ode to the old internet.  I want to tell my story, and I think this site will help me do that.  I hope it also makes me a better writer, and that I don't get in trouble for what I say!
