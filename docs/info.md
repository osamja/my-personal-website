# Deployment
 - To deploy, rather than running the deploy script, we should just run 
    `npm run build`
 - Find out which processes are listening on which ports
    `sudo netstat -tulpn`

# Development
 - Use nodemon to detect changes to server and hot reload page
    `node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js server.js`
